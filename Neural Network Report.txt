Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
This analysis is to help Alphabet Soup Charity determine how to fund more successful organizations. 

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
I used relu as an activation function because I felt the data was close to a linear shape. 


I was able to achieve the model to perform at 72% accuracy. 

In efforts to optimize the model I applied my knowledge of ETL. I placed the column ASK_AMT into bins to reduce the number of unique data and applied get_dummies to have a return on "0" and "1". 
After a few attempts I removed the "other" columns for the Later I ran a tuner to determine what is the best model.

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
